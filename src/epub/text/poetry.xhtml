				<span>I am the centre</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a circle of pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exceeding its boundaries in every direction</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The business of the bland sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has no affair with me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my congested cosmos of agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which there is no escape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On infinitely prolonged nerve-vibrations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or in contraction</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the pin-point nucleus of being</span>

				<span>
					<span>It is</span>
					<span>within</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is without.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sensitized area</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Is identical</span>
					<span>with the extensity</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of intension</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I am the false quantity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the harmony of physiological potentiality</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaining self-control</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should be consonant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In time</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pain is no stronger than the resisting force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pain calls up in me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The struggle is equal</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The open window is full of a voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fashionable portrait-painter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Running up-stairs to a woman’s apartment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings</span>

			<p>
				<span>I am climbing a distorted mountain of agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Incidentally with the exhaustion of control</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I reach the summit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gradually subside into anticipation of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which never comes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For another mountain is growing up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Which</span>
					<span>goaded by the unavoidable</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must traverse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Traversing myself</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Something in the delirium of night-hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confuses while intensifying sensibility</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blurring spatial contours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So aiding elusion of the circumscribed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the gurgling of a crucified wild beast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes from so far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the foam on the stretched muscles of a mouth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is no part of myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a climax in sensibility</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When pain surpassing itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes exotic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ego succeeds in unifying the positive and negative poles of sensation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uniting the opposing and resisting forces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lascivious revelation</span>
			</p>
			<p>

				<span>Negation of myself as a unit</span>

				<span class="i3">Vacuum interlude</span>

				<span>Man of absolute physical equilibrium</span>

				<span>Every plank or clod you plant your feet on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes roots for those limbs</span>

				<span>So at the same time</span>

				<span>Your movements</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unassailable</span>

				<span>Savor of the airy-fairy of the ballet</span>

				<br/>
				<span>With the same incautious aloofness</span>

				<span>Of intense occupation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it snuffles the trail of the female</span>

			<p>
				<span>Your genius</span>

				<br/>
				<span>In the opposite direction</span>

				<span>His articulations were excellent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Still</span>
					<span>where Giovanni Bapini was cymophanous</span>

				<span>His acolytian sincerity</span>

				<span>Continually cutting off an angle from Paszkowski’s</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Being an aristocrat it went on looking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As plainly piled up as ever</span>

				<span>No book ever explained what to be young is</span>

				<span>But they look so much more important for that</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giovanni was in continuous exstacy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Induced by the imposing look of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Giovanni Bapini spoke of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could not tell</span>

				<span>How completely more precious</span>

				<span>Would be such knowledge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As how many toes the philosopher Giovanni Bapini had</span>

				<br/>
				<span>For pity’s sake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Let us think of her as she</span>
					<span>to save time</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing the minor Giovanni</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting at the major Giovanni’s feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made sure he must be counting his toes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>All to the contrary</span>
					<span>he was picking the philosopher’s brains</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Happy in the security that when he had done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would still be youthful enough to sort out his own</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He listened at the elder’s lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That taught him of earthquakes and women</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of women⁠⸻⁠⸻⁠⸻</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His manners were abominable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would kill a woman</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quite inconspicuously it is true</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And neglect to attend her funeral</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mean the older man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what he told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giovanni Franchi</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About these pernicious persons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was so extremely good for him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It entirely spoilt his first love-affair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To such an extent</span>
					<span>it never came off</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We have read of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Trattoria</span>
					<span>meaning eating house.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Piazzas</span>
					<span>or squares</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The Pitti Palace</span>
					<span>enormous</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And Paszkowski’s</span>
					<span>for beer</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All are in Firenze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firenze is Florence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some think it is a woman with flowers in her hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But <strong>no</strong></span>
					<span>it is a city with stones on the streets</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Giovanni Bapini often said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everybody in Firenze knows me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And everybody did</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Excepting⁠—That is</span>
					<span>she didn’t</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She never knew what he was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or how he was himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet she uniquely was the one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To speculate</span>
					<span>upon the number of his toes</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The days growing longer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fulfilling her of curiosity</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She made a moth’s-net</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of metaphor and miracles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the incandescent breath of civilizations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She chased by moon-and-morn light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Philosopher’s toes</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>As virginal</span>
					<span>as had he never worn them</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear of “white marks mean money”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All quicks and cores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fluttered to her fantasy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell into her lap</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While she gathered her ferny flounces about them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They inappropriately passed</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Giovanni Franchi was there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He almost winked it at her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he was there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyes were intrepid with phantom secrets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Philosopher had flung to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as she tripped by him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>She guessed</span>
					<span>these all</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>All</span>
					<span>but the number of those toes</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She made diurnal pilgrimage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the trattoria</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To eat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Trout</span>
					<span>that might have been trained for circuses</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If minarets</span>
					<span>grew in miniature whirlpools</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And mayonnaise</span>
					<span>that helped her to forget</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That what is underneath</span>
					<span>need never matter</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She put all minor riddles out of her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What was the under-cover of Franchi’s book</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telling to the plaid pattern of the table-cloth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too shy to interrogate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She sent ambassadors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the disciple</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh rats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Quite manifest</span>
					<span>that Giovanni Franchi</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some semieffigy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Damned by scholiums</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Knew no more</span>
					<span>how many toes⁠—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Than</span>
					<span>Giovanni Bapini knew himself</span>

				<span>an instigation of the reaction of man</span>

				<span>
					<span>Patience said Gina</span>

				<span>
					<span>The dish</span>

				<span>What had Miovanni made of his ego</span>

				<br/>
				<span>One never asked the other</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>So they</span>
					<span>the wise ones</span>
					<span>eat their suppers in peace</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of what their peace consisted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We cannot say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only that he was magnificently man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She insignificantly a woman who understood</span>

				<span>
					<span>Understanding</span>
					<span>what is that</span>

				<span class="i8">It so seldom is</span>

				<span>While Miovanni thought alone in the dark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Gina supposed that peeping</span>
					<span>she might see</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>A round light</span>
					<span>shining</span>
					<span>where his mind was</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She never opened the door</span>

				<span>Or even</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That she should see</span>
					<span>Nothing at all</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So while he thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She hung out of the window</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watching for falling stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when a star fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>She wished</span>
					<span>that still</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Miovanni would love her to-morrow</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>Never gave any heed to the matter</span>

				<span>He did</span>

			<p>
				<span>Gina was a woman</span>

					<p>
						<span>who defied</span>

						<span>the protoform of Who made him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>but has not denied</span>

						<span>Him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>obeyed</span>
